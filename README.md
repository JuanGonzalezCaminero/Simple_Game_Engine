This is a simple 2D game engine written in C++ using the SDL library. It was designed and implemented from scratch as a self-learning project.

Many features are still missing and will most likely remain so as the project was meant mainly as a place to test and learn C++ and related technologies such as gtest or Cmake, it contains some design flaws that would need refactoring part of the project and it is not a priority right now.

Nevertheless, a demo can be compiled and run using the CMakeLists found at the project's root, which shows the intended usage of the library.
